The need for a script like this came from my partner's job.

Being a screenwriter, she often needs to send multiple review of the same document to her employer. When doing so, it seems to be customary to
highlight the changes between two version of the same file, so that it can be noticed at a glance.

I've just decided to try and provide her with something automated, to avoid the burden of manually going through the content each time.
